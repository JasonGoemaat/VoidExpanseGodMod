# LottaCargo

This mod adds a new skill similar to the 'Space Optimization' skill which adds inventory slots
to your ship for picking up items.  The differences:

* Removes requirements (normally is deep in the skill tree, now it can be chosen immediately)
* Removes cost (normally costs 7 skill points)
* Increases capacity (normally 4 per level, now 100 + 50 per level)
